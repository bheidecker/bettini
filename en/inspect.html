department.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div class=\&quot;mt-8 bg-gray-50 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;dl class=\&quot;divide-y divide-gray-200\&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div

              &lt;p&gt;The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. \nWe can detect in the ECG your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. \nThe process of obtaining an ECG is simple. \nA nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, \nand within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

         &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. \nDuring that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.\nThis way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the \ncase of the 48-hour ECG.\nThis 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n              External event recorder\n

recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.\nWhen you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.\nIt is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when \nyour heart makes extra beats).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n

minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the \nskin of your upper chest.\nSince the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic \nrhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.\nSince those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

text-gray-500\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;In order to get a good overview, what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we have a device that you can \ncarry for a total of 24 hours. \nIt is not large and can be worn at your hip.\nThat device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day \nand every 30 minutes during the night.\nThis way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at \nspecific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n

objectively test your physical fitness.\nAlso, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you \nexercise.\nFurthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise \ntolerance.\nECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may \nrequire further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900

class=\&quot;text-base text-gray-500\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart \nmuscle, function of the walls and the valves. \nAlso, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any known relevant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt

completely blocked.\nWith dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test \ndysfunction of your valves with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base

categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.\nIt is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, \nsince it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900

you have been diagnosed with a relevant \nvalve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

biopsies.\nTypically, we obtain up to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.\nYou may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.\nThis procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive \nprocedure through a small catheter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n

decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias \nshould they occur.\nWith severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.\nIf the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &amp;lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will \noffer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.\nDuring the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have \nthe highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.\nShould the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nShould that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/dl&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&quot;,

We have done the \nfirst study in humans resuming sports after 3 months and did not observe any medical issues developing after that \ninterval.\nIf you would like to read more about myocarditis, you may be also interested in the website of the Myocarditis \nFoundation, with which I collaborate closely: \n&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n          &lt;div class=\&quot;specialty-element pt-6\&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-lg\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;button type=\&quot;button\&quot; class=\&quot;specialties-toggle-btn text-left w-full flex gap-2 items-start text-gray-400\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;h-7 flex items-center\&quot;&gt;\n                  &lt;svg class=\&quot;rotate-0 h-6 w-6 transform\&quot; xmlns=\&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\&quot; fill=\&quot;none\&quot; viewBox=\&quot;0 0 24 24\&quot; stroke-width=\&quot;2\&quot; stroke=\&quot;currentColor\&quot; aria-hidden=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;path stroke-linecap=\&quot;round\&quot; stroke-linejoin=\&quot;round\&quot; d=\&quot;M19 9l-7 7-7-7\&quot; /&gt;\n                  &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;font-medium text-gray-900\&quot;&gt;\n                  Sarcoidosis\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/dt&gt;\n            &lt;dd class=\&quot;mt-2 pr-12 hidden\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\&quot;pl-8 text-base text-gray-500 space-y-4\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;Sarcoidosis is a disease that leads to accumulation of inflammatory cells (the body’s defense cells) in the shape of \nround-shaped granulomas that may occur in any part of the body.\nAs cardiologist, we treat patients with cardiac involvement, but it affects most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. \nThe reason why someone develops sarcoidosis is still unknown, but a reaction to environmental factors (dust, chemicals, \ninfectious agents) are suspected to which the immune system responds.\nVery often the patient also report that they had a lot of stress preceding the manifestation of the disease.\nStress is a common trigger of autoimmune diseases. \nSarcoidosis is treatable, but early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n          &lt;div class=\&quot;specialty-element pt-6\&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-lg\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;button type=\&quot;button\&quot; class=\&quot;specialties-toggle-btn text-left w-full flex gap-2 items-start text-gray-400\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;h-7 flex items-center\&quot;&gt;\n                  &lt;svg class=\&quot;rotate-0 h-6 w-6 transform\&quot; xmlns=\&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\&quot; fill=\&quot;none\&quot; viewBox=\&quot;0 0 24 24\&quot; stroke-width=\&quot;2\&quot; stroke=\&quot;currentColor\&quot; aria-hidden=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;path stroke-linecap=\&quot;round\&quot; stroke-linejoin=\&quot;round\&quot; d=\&quot;M19 9l-7 7-7-7\&quot; /&gt;\n                  &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;font-medium text-gray-900\&quot;&gt;\n                  Amyloidosis\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/dt&gt;\n            &lt;dd class=\&quot;mt-2 pr-12 hidden\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\&quot;pl-8 text-base text-gray-500 space-y-4\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can deposited in various organs including the heart.\nIn our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.\nDeposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, leading potentially to heart failure and arrhythmias.\nAppropriate medical therapy that may be frequently adjusted is very important for the clinical course of a patient.\nEndomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).\nTherefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.\nOnly if the suspicion is very low, we may do imaging first, since non-invasive imaging may sometimes miss cases.\nFrequently, also the nervous system is involved, so we work closely with our neurology team, to have that checked for \nyou as well.

Also, the heart can lose its pump function and get weaker over time leading to symptoms of \nheart failure.\nUsually, the right chamber of the heart is primarily affected, which led to the name of the disease.\nHowever, also the left chamber can be affected in combination and in very rare cases in isolation. \nARVC is a genetic disease with first symptom onset from age 10 to 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n          &lt;div class=\&quot;specialty-element pt-6\&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-lg\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;button type=\&quot;button\&quot;

              &lt;p&gt;The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. \nWe can detect in the ECG your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. \nThe process of obtaining an ECG is simple. \nA nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, \nand within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

         &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. \nDuring that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.\nThis way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the \ncase of the 48-hour ECG.\nThis 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n              External event recorder\n

recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.\nWhen you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.\nIt is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when \nyour heart makes extra beats).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n

minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the \nskin of your upper chest.\nSince the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic \nrhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.\nSince those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

\nIt is not large and can be worn at your hip.\nThat device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day \nand every 30 minutes during the night.\nThis way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at \nspecific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n

objectively test your physical fitness.\nAlso, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you \nexercise.\nFurthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise \ntolerance.\nECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may \nrequire further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900

class=\&quot;text-base text-gray-500\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart \nmuscle, function of the walls and the valves. \nAlso, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any known relevant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt

completely blocked.\nWith dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test \ndysfunction of your valves with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base

categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.\nIt is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, \nsince it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900

you have been diagnosed with a relevant \nvalve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

biopsies.\nTypically, we obtain up to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.\nYou may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.\nThis procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive \nprocedure through a small catheter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n

decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias \nshould they occur.\nWith severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.\nIf the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &amp;lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will \noffer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.\nDuring the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have \nthe highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.\nShould the pump function not

We have done the \nfirst study in humans resuming sports after 3 months and did not observe any medical issues developing after that \ninterval.\nIf you would like to read more about myocarditis, you may be also interested in the website of the Myocarditis \nFoundation, with which I collaborate closely: \n&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n          &lt;div class=\&quot;specialty-element pt-6\&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-lg\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;button type=\&quot;button\&quot; class=\&quot;specialties-toggle-btn text-left w-full flex gap-2 items-start text-gray-400\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;h-7 flex items-center\&quot;&gt;\n                  &lt;svg class=\&quot;rotate-0 h-6 w-6 transform\&quot; xmlns=\&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\&quot; fill=\&quot;none\&quot; viewBox=\&quot;0 0 24 24\&quot; stroke-width=\&quot;2\&quot; stroke=\&quot;currentColor\&quot; aria-hidden=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;path stroke-linecap=\&quot;round\&quot; stroke-linejoin=\&quot;round\&quot; d=\&quot;M19 9l-7 7-7-7\&quot; /&gt;\n                  &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;font-medium text-gray-900\&quot;&gt;\n                  Sarcoidosis\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/dt&gt;\n            &lt;dd class=\&quot;mt-2 pr-12 hidden\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\&quot;pl-8 text-base text-gray-500 space-y-4\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;Sarcoidosis is a disease that leads to accumulation of inflammatory cells (the body’s defense cells) in the shape of \nround-shaped granulomas that may occur in any part of the body.\nAs cardiologist, we treat patients with cardiac involvement, but it affects most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. \nThe reason why someone develops sarcoidosis is still unknown, but a reaction to environmental factors (dust, chemicals, \ninfectious agents) are suspected to which the immune system responds.\nVery often the patient also report that they had a lot of stress preceding the manifestation of the disease.\nStress is a common trigger of autoimmune diseases. \nSarcoidosis is treatable, but early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n          &lt;div class=\&quot;specialty-element pt-6\&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-lg\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;button type=\&quot;button\&quot; class=\&quot;specialties-toggle-btn text-left w-full flex gap-2 items-start text-gray-400\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;h-7 flex items-center\&quot;&gt;\n                  &lt;svg class=\&quot;rotate-0 h-6 w-6 transform\&quot; xmlns=\&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\&quot; fill=\&quot;none\&quot; viewBox=\&quot;0 0 24 24\&quot; stroke-width=\&quot;2\&quot; stroke=\&quot;currentColor\&quot; aria-hidden=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;path stroke-linecap=\&quot;round\&quot; stroke-linejoin=\&quot;round\&quot; d=\&quot;M19 9l-7 7-7-7\&quot; /&gt;\n                  &lt;/svg&gt;\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\&quot;font-medium text-gray-900\&quot;&gt;\n                  Amyloidosis\n                &lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/dt&gt;\n            &lt;dd class=\&quot;mt-2 pr-12 hidden\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\&quot;pl-8 text-base text-gray-500 space-y-4\&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can deposited in various organs including the heart.\nIn our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.\nDeposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, leading potentially to heart failure and arrhythmias.\nAppropriate medical therapy that may be frequently adjusted is very important for the clinical course of a patient.\nEndomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).\nTherefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.\nOnly if the suspicion is very low, we may do imaging first, since non-invasive imaging may sometimes miss cases.\nFrequently, also the nervous system is involved, so we work closely with our neurology team, to have that checked for \nyou as well. Should you be diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will get you a timely appointment with our hemato-oncologist, to make \nsure effective treatment will be initiated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n          &lt;div class=\&quot;specialty-element pt-6\&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-lg\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;button type=\&quot;button\&quot;

Also, the heart can lose its pump function and get weaker over time leading to symptoms of \nheart failure.\nUsually, the right chamber of the heart is primarily affected, which led to the name of the disease.\nHowever, also the left chamber can be affected in combination and in very rare cases in isolation. \nARVC is a genetic disease with first symptom onset from age 10 to 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/dd&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n          &lt;div class=\&quot;specialty-element pt-6\&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-lg\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;button type=\&quot;button\&quot;

    &quot;&lt;p&gt;The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. \nWe can detect in the ECG your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. \nThe process of obtaining an ECG is simple. \nA nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, \nand within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. \nDuring that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.\nThis way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the \ncase of the 48-hour ECG.\nThis 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.\nWhen you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.\nIt is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when \nyour heart makes extra beats).&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Implantation of an event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the \nskin of your upper chest.\nSince the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic \nrhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.\nSince those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In order to get a good overview, what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we have a device that you can \ncarry for a total of 24 hours. \nIt is not large and can be worn at your hip.\nThat device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day \nand every 30 minutes during the night.\nThis way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at \nspecific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Exercise-stress test is a great way to objectively test your physical fitness.\nAlso, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you \nexercise.\nFurthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise \ntolerance.\nECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may \nrequire further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart \nmuscle, function of the walls and the valves. \nAlso, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any known relevant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.\nWith dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test \ndysfunction of your valves with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In certain clinical scenarios, we may have to check if your carotid arteries or other arteries of the body are healthy \nor if they have narrowings that may require intervention.\nFor that we will use again ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging of the heart will allow us to detect structural abnormalities in the heart, inflammation, \nstorage diseases or poor blood supply to the heart.\nAlso, CMR may reveal prognostic information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;PET is a technology that we use in particular for patients with sarcoidosis.\nSarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that can be categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.\nIt is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, \nsince it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the suspicion for narrowed or obstructed vessels in the heart is high or if you have been diagnosed with a relevant \nvalve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In patients, in whom the cause for their illness of the heart could not be identified yet, we may obtain endomyocardial \nor heart biopsies.\nTypically, we obtain up to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.\nYou may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.\nThis procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive \nprocedure through a small catheter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias \nshould they occur.\nWith severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.\nIf the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &amp;lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will \noffer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.\nDuring the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have \nthe highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.\nShould the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nShould that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,

    &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias \nshould they occur.\nWith severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.\nIf the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &amp;lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will \noffer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.\nDuring the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have \nthe highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.\nShould the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nShould that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart that may be caused by a virus or other triggering factors.\nWe typically see an autoimmune reaction that may sometimes require medications that suppress the immune system.\nThe large majority of cases with myocarditis recover well.\nSome cases are more severe and require more intense monitoring, therapy and more frequent follow up.\nAfter myocarditis, it is strongly recommended not to do any heavy exercise for at least 3 months, as the risk of \nexercise induced arrhythmias and worsening of the disease has been reported in animal experiments.  We have done the \nfirst study in humans resuming sports after 3 months and did not observe any medical issues developing after that \ninterval.\nIf you would like to read more about myocarditis, you may be also interested in the website of the Myocarditis \nFoundation, with which I collaborate closely: \n&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Sarcoidosis is a disease that leads to accumulation of inflammatory cells (the body’s defense cells) in the shape of \nround-shaped granulomas that may occur in any part of the body.\nAs cardiologist, we treat patients with cardiac involvement, but it affects most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. \nThe reason why someone develops sarcoidosis is still unknown, but a reaction to environmental factors (dust, chemicals, \ninfectious agents) are suspected to which the immune system responds.\nVery often the patient also report that they had a lot of stress preceding the manifestation of the disease.\nStress is a common trigger of autoimmune diseases. \nSarcoidosis is treatable, but early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can deposited in various organs including the heart.\nIn our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.\nDeposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, leading potentially to heart failure and arrhythmias.\nAppropriate medical therapy that may be frequently adjusted is very important for the clinical course of a patient.\nEndomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).\nTherefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool, when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.\nOnly if the suspicion is very low, we may do imaging first, since non-invasive imaging may sometimes miss cases.\nFrequently, also the nervous system is involved, so we work closely with our neurology team, to have that checked for \nyou as well. Should you be diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will get you a timely appointment with our hemato-oncologist, to make \nsure effective treatment will be initiated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Cardiooncology covers the care of patients who have heart disease or who are at risk of heart disease before, \nduring or after cancer therapy.\nThe goal is to provide the most effective cancer therapy, while reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications to a \nminimum. \nThe care involves close interdisciplinary collaboration between the cardiologist, the hematologist or oncologist. \nA specific new field of cardiooncology is checkpoint inhibitor induced myocarditis.\nThe goal of check point inhibitor therapy in oncology is to make the patient’s immune defense stronger and more \naggressive in advanced cancer illness through a mechanism of “disinbition”, which enables it to fight metastatic \ndisease.\nHowever, this disinhibition comes with the price of a higher risk for autoimmune reactions, and myocarditis – an \ninflammation of the heart muscle – can develop. \nIf check point inhibitor induced myocarditis occurs, immediate referral for treatment in a specialized center is \ncrucial for a patient’s outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;HCM is a disease, which is defined by abnormally thickened heart muscle cells.\nThis is also called hypertrophy.\nAs a consequence, the walls of the heart get thickened and stiffer.\nThis sometimes makes it harder for the heart to pump and relax and sometimes the patients feel chest pain or in more \nadvanced stages develop edema in the legs or lungs – fluid accumulation in legs or lungs.\nPatients may also develop electrical conduction problems or arrhythmias.Sometimes the diagnosis of HCM is made late, \nas symptoms may develop late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a structural disease of the heart muscle, where normal heart \nmuscle is replaced by fatty fibrous tissue.\nDue to the fatty replacement, electrical signal conduction in the heart is hampered, leading to irregular rhythm that \ncan be life-threatening. Also, the heart can lose its pump function and get weaker over time leading to symptoms of \nheart failure.\nUsually, the right chamber of the heart is primarily affected, which led to the name of the disease.\nHowever, also the left chamber can be affected in combination and in very rare cases in isolation. \nARVC is a genetic disease with first symptom onset from age 10 to 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.\nTCM was first described in Japan in 1990 and named after Takotsubo - a tool that is used in Japan to catch octopus.\nIt refers to the shape of the heart patients develop, when they have TCM.\nTypically, one part of the left chamber of the heart enlarges in a balloon shape form (most of the time the apex of \nthe heart) leading to poor pump function in that area, while the rest of the chamber tries to compensate. \nPatients with TCM frequently present with severe chest pain, as if they are having a heart attack or shortness of \nbreath and general weakness associated with symptoms of heart failure.\nTCM in most cases is a temporary condition with high chance for full recovery. \nHowever, it requires several days of monitoring, as severe arrhythmias may occur in the acute phase. \nIt can be triggered by high emotional or physical stress and pro-adrenergic medications that are used in the intensive \ncare unit.\nHowever, sometimes we find takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients, who were not exposed to any of those known triggers. \nCertainly, more research is needed in this area to understand its pathophysiology better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare disease of the heart muscle that occurs during the final month of pregnancy up to \nfive months after delivery, which may lead to heart failure.\nImportantly, other causes of cardiomyopathy must be ruled out first.\nIn most cases, peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs right after delivery.\nThe degree of the severity of symptoms varies greatly between women and does not seem to affect the chance for recovery.\nFor example, women with severely decreased heart function due to peripartum cardiomyopathy may completely recover their \nheart function.\nOverall, compared to other cardiomyopathies (diseases of the heart muscle), patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy \nhave a good chance for recovery.\nAs with other types of cardiomyopathy, early treatment initiation is key.\nThe risk for recurrence of the disease during subsequent pregnancy is generally increased for patients with peripartum \ncardiomyopathy and is particularly high for woman who did not fully recover their heart function.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,

    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Frau Dr. Heidecker ist nicht nur eine engagierte und empathische Ärztin, sondern auch eine ausgewiesene Expertin auf ihrem Gebiet.\nDa in meinem Fall die kardiale Sarkoidose von anderen Ärzten nicht erkannt und an anderer Stelle nicht behandelt werden wollte, \nbin ich froh, dass Dr. Heidecker die Diagnose vorangetrieben und die richtige Behandlung eingeleitet hat. \nIch halte bei dieser seltenen Erkrankung insbesondere ihre internationale Vernetzung und die vergleichsweise hohe Zahl \nan Sarkoidose-Patienten für sehr wichtig und nützlich. \nAuch über meinen langen Behandlungszeitraum war Dr. Heidecker immer ansprechbar und informiert. \nImmer hat sie auch versucht, interdisziplinär Lösungen zu finden.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Seit drei Jahren bin ich bei Frau Dr. Heidecker wegen meiner Herzsarkoidose in Behandlung. \nDie Regeluntersuchung läuft so ab, dass zunächst ein EKG geschrieben wird und anschließend der Herzschrittmacher \nkontrolliert wird und das Gespräch und die Ultraschalluntersuchung des Herzens durch Frau Dr. Heidecker stattfindet. \nZuletzt wird noch eine Blutentnahme vorgenommen. \nThema des Gespräches ist natürlich das körperliche Befinden sowie die Medikation und evtl. vorzunehmende Anpassungen.\nEs ist mir ein Bedürfnis, herauszustellen, dass Frau Dr. Heidecker eine sehr warmherzige und menschliche Ärztin ist, \ndie sich laienverständlich ausdrückt und die alle Fragen geduldig beantwortet, die man stellen möchte. \nSie nimmt sich Zeit und ist sich auch für ein privates Wort nicht zu schade. Ich schätze ihre zugewandte und \nkompetente Art extrem und bin sehr dankbar, in ihr eine Spezialistin auf diesem Gebiet gefunden zu haben. \nDafür nehme ich auch eine 500-Km-Anreise in Kauf. Mit dieser ernsthaften Diagnose fühle ich mich bei Frau Dr. Heidecker in den allerbesten Händen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Heidecker is not only a dedicated and empathetic doctor, but also a proven expert in her field.\nSince in my case the cardiac sarcoidosis was not recognized by other doctors and was not treated elsewhere, \nI am glad that Dr. Heidecker pushed ahead with the diagnosis and initiated the right treatment. \nWith this rare disease, I appreciate her international network and the comparatively high number of sarcoid patients \nshe is treating to be very important and valuable. Even during my long treatment period, Dr. Heidecker was always \napproachable and informed. She always tried to find interdisciplinary solutions, when indicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;

        &quot;&lt;p&gt;The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. \nWe can detect in the ECG your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. \nThe process of obtaining an ECG is simple. \nA nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, \nand within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. \nDuring that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.\nThis way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the \ncase of the 48-hour ECG.\nThis 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.\nWhen you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.\nIt is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when \nyour heart makes extra beats).&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Implantation of an event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the \nskin of your upper chest.\nSince the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic \nrhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.\nSince those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In order to get a good overview, what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we have a device that you can \ncarry for a total of 24 hours. \nIt is not large and can be worn at your hip.\nThat device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day \nand every 30 minutes during the night.\nThis way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at \nspecific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Exercise-stress test is a great way to objectively test your physical fitness.\nAlso, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you \nexercise.\nFurthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise \ntolerance.\nECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may \nrequire further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart \nmuscle, function of the walls and the valves. \nAlso, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any known relevant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.\nWith dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test \ndysfunction of your valves with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In certain clinical scenarios, we may have to check if your carotid arteries or other arteries of the body are healthy \nor if they have narrowings that may require intervention.\nFor that we will use again ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging of the heart will allow us to detect structural abnormalities in the heart, inflammation, \nstorage diseases or poor blood supply to the heart.\nAlso, CMR may reveal prognostic information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;PET is a technology that we use in particular for patients with sarcoidosis.\nSarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that can be categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.\nIt is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, \nsince it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the suspicion for narrowed or obstructed vessels in the heart is high or if you have been diagnosed with a relevant \nvalve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,

        &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the suspicion for narrowed or obstructed vessels in the heart is high or if you have been diagnosed with a relevant \nvalve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In patients, in whom the cause for their illness of the heart could not be identified yet, we may obtain endomyocardial \nor heart biopsies.\nTypically, we obtain up to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.\nYou may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.\nThis procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive \nprocedure through a small catheter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias \nshould they occur.\nWith severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.\nIf the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &amp;lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will \noffer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.\nDuring the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have \nthe highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.\nShould the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nShould that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;

        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart that may be caused by a virus or other triggering factors.\nWe typically see an autoimmune reaction that may sometimes require medications that suppress the immune system.\nThe large majority of cases with myocarditis recover well.\nSome cases are more severe and require more intense monitoring, therapy and more frequent follow up.\nAfter myocarditis, it is strongly recommended not to do any heavy exercise for at least 3 months, as the risk of \nexercise induced arrhythmias and worsening of the disease has been reported in animal experiments.  We have done the \nfirst study in humans resuming sports after 3 months and did not observe any medical issues developing after that \ninterval.\nIf you would like to read more about myocarditis, you may be also interested in the website of the Myocarditis \nFoundation, with which I collaborate closely: \n&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Sarcoidosis is a disease that leads to accumulation of inflammatory cells (the body’s defense cells) in the shape of \nround-shaped granulomas that may occur in any part of the body.\nAs cardiologist, we treat patients with cardiac involvement, but it affects most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. \nThe reason why someone develops sarcoidosis is still unknown, but a reaction to environmental factors (dust, chemicals, \ninfectious agents) are suspected to which the immune system responds.\nVery often the patient also report that they had a lot of stress preceding the manifestation of the disease.\nStress is a common trigger of autoimmune diseases. \nSarcoidosis is treatable, but early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can deposited in various organs including the heart.\nIn our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.\nDeposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, leading potentially to heart failure and arrhythmias.\nAppropriate medical therapy that may be frequently adjusted is very important for the clinical course of a patient.\nEndomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).\nTherefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool, when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.\nOnly if the suspicion is very low, we may do imaging first, since non-invasive imaging may sometimes miss cases.\nFrequently, also the nervous system is involved, so we work closely with our neurology team, to have that checked for \nyou as well. Should you be diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will get you a timely appointment with our hemato-oncologist, to make \nsure effective treatment will be initiated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Cardiooncology covers the care of patients who have heart disease or who are at risk of heart disease before, \nduring or after cancer therapy.\nThe goal is to provide the most effective cancer therapy, while reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications to a \nminimum. \nThe care involves close interdisciplinary collaboration between the cardiologist, the hematologist or oncologist. \nA specific new field of cardiooncology is checkpoint inhibitor induced myocarditis.\nThe goal of check point inhibitor therapy in oncology is to make the patient’s immune defense stronger and more \naggressive in advanced cancer illness through a mechanism of “disinbition”, which enables it to fight metastatic \ndisease.\nHowever, this disinhibition comes with the price of a higher risk for autoimmune reactions, and myocarditis – an \ninflammation of the heart muscle – can develop. \nIf check point inhibitor induced myocarditis occurs, immediate referral for treatment in a specialized center is \ncrucial for a patient’s outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;HCM is a disease, which is defined by abnormally thickened heart muscle cells.\nThis is also called hypertrophy.\nAs a consequence, the walls of the heart get thickened and stiffer.\nThis sometimes makes it harder for the heart to pump and relax and sometimes the patients feel chest pain or in more \nadvanced stages develop edema in the legs or lungs – fluid accumulation in legs or lungs.\nPatients may also develop electrical conduction problems or arrhythmias.Sometimes the diagnosis of HCM is made late, \nas symptoms may develop late.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a structural disease of the heart muscle, where normal heart \nmuscle is replaced by fatty fibrous tissue.\nDue to the fatty replacement, electrical signal conduction in the heart is hampered, leading to irregular rhythm that \ncan be life-threatening. Also, the heart can lose its pump function and get weaker over time leading to symptoms of \nheart failure.\nUsually, the right chamber of the heart is primarily affected, which led to the name of the disease.\nHowever, also the left chamber can be affected in combination and in very rare cases in isolation. \nARVC is a genetic disease with first symptom onset from age 10 to 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.\nTCM was first described in Japan in 1990 and named after Takotsubo - a tool that is used in Japan to catch octopus.\nIt refers to the shape of the heart patients develop, when they have TCM.\nTypically, one part of the left chamber of the heart enlarges in a balloon shape form (most of the time the apex of \nthe heart) leading to poor pump function in that area, while the rest of the chamber tries to compensate. \nPatients with TCM frequently present with severe chest pain, as if they are having a heart attack or shortness of \nbreath and general weakness associated with symptoms of heart failure.\nTCM in most cases is a temporary condition with high chance for full recovery. \nHowever, it requires several days of monitoring, as severe arrhythmias may occur in the acute phase. \nIt can be triggered by high emotional or physical stress and pro-adrenergic medications that are used in the intensive \ncare unit.\nHowever, sometimes we find takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients, who were not exposed to any of those known triggers. \nCertainly, more research is needed in this area to understand its pathophysiology better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare disease of the heart muscle that occurs during the final month of pregnancy up to \nfive months after delivery, which may lead to heart failure.\nImportantly, other causes of cardiomyopathy must be ruled out first.\nIn most cases, peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs right after delivery.\nThe degree of the severity of symptoms varies greatly between women and does not seem to affect the chance for recovery.\nFor example, women with severely decreased heart function due to peripartum cardiomyopathy may completely recover their \nheart function.\nOverall, compared to other cardiomyopathies (diseases of the heart muscle), patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy \nhave a good chance for recovery.\nAs with other types of cardiomyopathy, early treatment initiation is key.\nThe risk for recurrence of the disease during subsequent pregnancy is generally increased for patients with peripartum \ncardiomyopathy and is particularly high for woman who did not fully recover their heart function.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,

        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Frau Dr. Heidecker ist nicht nur eine engagierte und empathische Ärztin, sondern auch eine ausgewiesene Expertin auf ihrem Gebiet.\nDa in meinem Fall die kardiale Sarkoidose von anderen Ärzten nicht erkannt und an anderer Stelle nicht behandelt werden wollte, \nbin ich froh, dass Dr. Heidecker die Diagnose vorangetrieben und die richtige Behandlung eingeleitet hat. \nIch halte bei dieser seltenen Erkrankung insbesondere ihre internationale Vernetzung und die vergleichsweise hohe Zahl \nan Sarkoidose-Patienten für sehr wichtig und nützlich. \nAuch über meinen langen Behandlungszeitraum war Dr. Heidecker immer ansprechbar und informiert. \nImmer hat sie auch versucht, interdisziplinär Lösungen zu finden.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Seit drei Jahren bin ich bei Frau Dr. Heidecker wegen meiner Herzsarkoidose in Behandlung. \nDie Regeluntersuchung läuft so ab, dass zunächst ein EKG geschrieben wird und anschließend der Herzschrittmacher \nkontrolliert wird und das Gespräch und die Ultraschalluntersuchung des Herzens durch Frau Dr. Heidecker stattfindet. \nZuletzt wird noch eine Blutentnahme vorgenommen. \nThema des Gespräches ist natürlich das körperliche Befinden sowie die Medikation und evtl. vorzunehmende Anpassungen.\nEs ist mir ein Bedürfnis, herauszustellen, dass Frau Dr. Heidecker eine sehr warmherzige und menschliche Ärztin ist, \ndie sich laienverständlich ausdrückt und die alle Fragen geduldig beantwortet, die man stellen möchte. \nSie nimmt sich Zeit und ist sich auch für ein privates Wort nicht zu schade. Ich schätze ihre zugewandte und \nkompetente Art extrem und bin sehr dankbar, in ihr eine Spezialistin auf diesem Gebiet gefunden zu haben. \nDafür nehme ich auch eine 500-Km-Anreise in Kauf. Mit dieser ernsthaften Diagnose fühle ich mich bei Frau Dr. Heidecker in den allerbesten Händen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Heidecker is not only a dedicated and empathetic doctor, but also a proven expert in her field.\nSince in my case the cardiac sarcoidosis was not recognized by other doctors and was not treated elsewhere, \nI am glad that Dr. Heidecker pushed ahead with the diagnosis and initiated the right treatment. \nWith this rare disease, I appreciate her international network and the comparatively high number of sarcoid patients \nshe is treating to be very important and valuable. Even during my long treatment period, Dr. Heidecker was always \napproachable and informed. She always tried to find interdisciplinary solutions, when indicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;
