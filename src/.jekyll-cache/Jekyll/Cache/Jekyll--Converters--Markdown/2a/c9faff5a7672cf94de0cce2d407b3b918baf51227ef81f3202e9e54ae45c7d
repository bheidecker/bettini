I"‘<p>This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.
With dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect 
that the heart vessels may be diseased.
You will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.
That way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.
If we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart donâ€™t pump as well under 
physical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some 
vessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.
If the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test 
dysfunction of your valves with this technology.</p>
