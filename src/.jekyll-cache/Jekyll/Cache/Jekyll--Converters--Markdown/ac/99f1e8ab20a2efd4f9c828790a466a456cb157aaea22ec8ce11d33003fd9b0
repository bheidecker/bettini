I"í<p>Sarcoidosis is a disease that leads to accumulation of inflammatory cells (the bodyâ€™s defense cells) in the shape of 
round-shaped granulomas that may occur in any part of the body.
As cardiologist, we treat patients with cardiac involvement, but it affects most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. 
The reason why someone develops sarcoidosis is still unkown, but a reaction to environmental factors (dust, chemicals, 
infectious agents) are suspected to which the immune system responds.
Very often the patient also report that they had a lot of stress preceding the manifestation of the disease.
Stress is a common trigger of autoimmune diseases. 
Sarcoidosis is treatable, but early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible damage.</p>
