<p>The research group of Dr. Bettina Heidecker investigates cardiomyopathies and heart failure.
Cardiomyopathy is a term that describes a diseased heart muscle.
Different types of cardiomyopathy can have genetic and/or acquired causes and risk factors.
Heart failure describes a loss of heart function, which leads to a state in which the heart is too weak to fully
function in everyday life.</p>

<p>The research of Dr. Heidecker and her team focuses in particular on the subject of inflammation of the heart muscle
and myocarditis.
Projects are developed in collaboration with international partners. Collaborations with other clinical institutions
as well as industry partners provide optimal resources to execute research from bench to bedside.
A combined approach of basic and translational science is applied in retrospective and prospective studies to advance
therapies for future patients.
Recent studies have been published in Lancet EClincal Medicine, the New England Journal of Medicine, Nature,
Nature Biotechnology, Nature Reviews Cardiology, the European Heart Journal, and the Journal of the American Medical
Association.</p>

<p>Dr. Heidecker has mentored students and fellows from Europe and the United States. Her mentees present at
international meetings and have been recipients of research awards including the Paul Dudley White International
Scholar Award of the American Heart Association, stipends for best master and best doctoral thesis, as well as
stipends from private foundations.</p>
