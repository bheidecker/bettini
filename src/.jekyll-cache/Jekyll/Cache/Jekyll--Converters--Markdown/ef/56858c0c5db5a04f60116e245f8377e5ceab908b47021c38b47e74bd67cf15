I"5<p>Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. 
During that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.
This way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the 
case of the 48-hour ECG.
This 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular 
daily activities.
The goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.</p>
