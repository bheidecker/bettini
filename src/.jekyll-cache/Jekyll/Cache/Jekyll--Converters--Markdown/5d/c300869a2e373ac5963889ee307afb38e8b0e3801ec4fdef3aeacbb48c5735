I"l<p>An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.
When you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.
It is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when 
your heart makes extra beats).</p>
