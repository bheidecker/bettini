I"!<p>HCM is a disease, which is defined by abnormally thickened heart muscle cells.
This is also called hypertrophy.
As a consequence, the walls of the heart get thickened and stiffer.
This sometimes makes it harder for the heart to pump and relax and sometimes the patients feel chest pain or in more 
advanced stages develop edema in the legs or lungs â€“ fluid accumulation in legs or lungs.
Patients may also develop electrical conduction problems or arrhythmias.Sometimes the diagnosis of HCM is made late, 
as symptoms may develop late.</p>
