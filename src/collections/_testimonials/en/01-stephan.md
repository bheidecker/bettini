Dr. Heidecker is not only a dedicated and empathetic doctor, but also a proven expert in her field.
Since in my case the cardiac sarcoidosis was not recognized by other doctors and was not treated elsewhere, 
I am glad that Dr. Heidecker pushed ahead with the diagnosis and initiated the right treatment. 
With this rare disease, I appreciate her international network and the comparatively high number of sarcoid patients 
she is treating to be very important and valuable. Even during my long treatment period, Dr. Heidecker was always 
approachable and informed. She always tried to find interdisciplinary solutions, when indicated.
