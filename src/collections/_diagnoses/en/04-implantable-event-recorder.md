heading: Implantable event recorder
---

Implantation of an event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the 
skin of your upper chest.
Since the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic 
rhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.
Since those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.
