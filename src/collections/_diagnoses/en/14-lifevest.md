If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias 
should they occur.
With severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.
If the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is < or = 35%, in most cases we will 
offer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.
During the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have 
the highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.
Should the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
Should that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.
