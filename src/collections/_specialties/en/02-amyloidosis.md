Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can deposited in various organs including the heart.
In our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.
Deposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, leading potentially to heart failure and arrhythmias.
Appropriate medical therapy that may be frequently adjusted is very important for the clinical course of a patient.
Endomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).
Therefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool, when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.
Only if the suspicion is very low, we may do imaging first, since non-invasive imaging may sometimes miss cases.
Frequently, also the nervous system is involved, so we work closely with our neurology team, to have that checked for 
you as well.
Should you be diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will get you a timely appointment with our hemato-oncologist, to make 
sure effective treatment will be initiated promptly.
