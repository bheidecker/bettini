Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare disease of the heart muscle that occurs during the final month of pregnancy up to 
five months after delivery, which may lead to heart failure.
Importantly, other causes of cardiomyopathy must be ruled out first.
In most cases, peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs right after delivery.
The degree of the severity of symptoms varies greatly between women and does not seem to affect the chance for recovery.
For example, women with severely decreased heart function due to peripartum cardiomyopathy may completely recover their 
heart function.
Overall, compared to other cardiomyopathies (diseases of the heart muscle), patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy 
have a good chance for recovery.
As with other types of cardiomyopathy, early treatment initiation is key.
The risk for recurrence of the disease during subsequent pregnancy is generally increased for patients with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy and is particularly high for woman who did not fully recover their heart function.
