              <p>The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. 
We can detect in the ECG your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. 
The process of obtaining an ECG is simple. 
A nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, 
and within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.</p>

              <p>Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. 
During that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.
This way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the 
case of the 48-hour ECG.
This 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular 
daily activities.
The goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.</p>

              <p>An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.

your heart makes extra beats).</p>

              <p>Implantation of an event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the 
skin of your upper chest.
Since the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic 
rhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.
Since those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.</p>

It is not large and can be worn at your hip.
That device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day 
and every 30 minutes during the night.
This way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at 
specific times of the day.</p>

Also, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you 
exercise.
Furthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise 
tolerance.
ECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may 
require further evaluation.</p>

              <p>In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart 
muscle, function of the walls and the valves. 
Also, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.
This information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.
During the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by 
structures in your heart.
Through collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.
This examination does not have any known relevant side effects.</p>

              <p>This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.
With dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect 
that the heart vessels may be diseased.
You will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.
That way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.
If we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under 
physical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some 
vessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.
If the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test 
dysfunction of your valves with this technology.</p>

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that can be categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.
It is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, 
since it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.</p>

              <p>If the suspicion for narrowed or obstructed vessels in the heart is high or if you have been diagnosed with a relevant 
valve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or 
cardiac catheterization.
Under local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter 
(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.
Then contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any 
narrowings or occlusion.
If there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.
A stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and 
remain there, once the balloon is inflated.
After that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.
After that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.
The procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.</p>

Typically, we obtain up to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.
The procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.
You may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.
This procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive 
procedure through a small catheter.</p>

              <p>If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias 
should they occur.
With severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.
If the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will 
offer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.
During the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have 
the highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.
Should the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
Should that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.</p>
