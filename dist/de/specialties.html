              <p>Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart that may be caused by a virus or other triggering factors.
We typically see an autoimmune reaction that may sometimes require medications that suppress the immune system.
The large majority of cases with myocarditis recover well.
Some cases are more severe and require more intense monitoring, therapy and more frequent follow up.
After myocarditis, it is strongly recommended not to do any heavy exercise for at least 3 months, as the risk of 
exercise induced arrhythmias and worsening of the disease has been reported in animal experiments.  We have done the 
first study in humans resuming sports after 3 months and did not observe any medical issues developing after that 
interval.
If you would like to read more about myocarditis, you may be also interested in the website of the Myocarditis 
Foundation, with which I collaborate closely: <a href="https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/">https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org</a></p>

              <p>Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can deposited in various organs including the heart.
In our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.
Deposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, leading potentially to heart failure and arrhythmias.
Appropriate medical therapy that may be frequently adjusted is very important for the clinical course of a patient.
Endomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).
Therefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool, when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.
Only if the suspicion is very low, we may do imaging first, since non-invasive imaging may sometimes miss cases.
Frequently, also the nervous system is involved, so we work closely with our neurology team, to have that checked for 
you as well.
Should you be diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will get you a timely appointment with our hemato-oncologist, to make 
sure effective treatment will be initiated promptly.</p>
