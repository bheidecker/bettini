abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. \nThe process of obtaining an ECG is simple. \nA nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, \nand within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n          &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900

text-gray-500\&quot;&gt;\n              &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. \nDuring that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.\nThis way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the \ncase of the 48-hour ECG.\nThis 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n          &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

  &lt;p&gt;An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.\nWhen you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.\nIt is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when \nyour heart makes extra beats).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n

a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the \nskin of your upper chest.\nSince the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic \nrhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.\nSince those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n          &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

            &lt;p&gt;In order to get a good overview, what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we have a device that you can \ncarry for a total of 24 hours. \nIt is not large and can be worn at your hip.\nThat device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day \nand every 30 minutes during the night.\nThis way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at \nspecific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/dd&gt;\n

high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise \ntolerance.\nECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may \nrequire further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n          &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

&lt;p&gt;In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart \nmuscle, function of the walls and the valves. \nAlso, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any known relevant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n          &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold text-gray-900 md:col-span-5\&quot;&gt;\n

             &lt;p&gt;This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.\nWith dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test \ndysfunction of your valves with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/dd&gt;\n          \n          &lt;dt class=\&quot;text-base font-bold

of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n

an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in

there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any

attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative

office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            &lt;/p&gt;\n

        &quot;&lt;p&gt;The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. \nWe can detect in the ECG your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. \nThe process of obtaining an ECG is simple. \nA nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, \nand within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. \nDuring that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.\nThis way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the \ncase of the 48-hour ECG.\nThis 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.\nWhen you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.\nIt is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when \nyour heart makes extra beats).&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Implantation of an event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the \nskin of your upper chest.\nSince the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic \nrhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.\nSince those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In order to get a good overview, what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we have a device that you can \ncarry for a total of 24 hours. \nIt is not large and can be worn at your hip.\nThat device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day \nand every 30 minutes during the night.\nThis way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at \nspecific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Exercise-stress test is a great way to objectively test your physical fitness.\nAlso, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you \nexercise.\nFurthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise \ntolerance.\nECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may \nrequire further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart \nmuscle, function of the walls and the valves. \nAlso, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any known relevant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.\nWith dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test \ndysfunction of your valves with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In certain clinical scenarios, we may have to check if your carotid arteries or other arteries of the body are healthy \nor if they have narrowings that may require intervention.\nFor that we will use again ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging of the heart will allow us to detect structural abnormalities in the heart, inflammation, \nstorage diseases or poor blood supply to the heart.\nAlso, CMR may reveal prognostic information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;PET is a technology that we use in particular for patients with sarcoidosis.\nSarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that can be categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.\nIt is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, \nsince it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the suspicion for narrowed or obstructed vessels in the heart is high or if you have been diagnosed with a relevant \nvalve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;In patients, in whom the cause for their illness of the heart could not be identified yet, we may obtain endomyocardial \nor heart biopsies.\nTypically, we obtain up to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.\nYou may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.\nThis procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive \nprocedure through a small catheter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias \nshould they occur.\nWith severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.\nIf the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &amp;lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will \noffer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.\nDuring the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have \nthe highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.\nShould the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nShould that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,

        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart that may be caused by a virus or other triggering factors.\nWe typically see an autoimmune reaction that may sometimes require medications that suppress the immune system.\nThe large majority of cases with myocarditis recover well.\nSome cases are more severe and require more intense monitoring, therapy and more frequent follow up.\nAfter myocarditis, it is strongly recommended not to do any heavy exercise for at least 3 months, as the risk of \nexercise induced arrhythmias and worsening of the disease has been reported in animal experiments.  We have done the \nfirst study in humans resuming sports after 3 months and did not observe any medical issues developing after that \ninterval.\nIf you would like to read more about myocarditis, you may be also interested in the website of the Myocarditis \nFoundation, with which I collaborate closely: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/\&quot;&gt;https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can deposited in various organs including the heart.\nIn our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.\nDeposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, leading potentially to heart failure and arrhythmias.\nAppropriate medical therapy that may be frequently adjusted is very important for the clinical course of a patient.\nEndomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).\nTherefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool, when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.\nOnly if the suspicion is very low, we may do imaging first, since non-invasive imaging may sometimes miss cases.\nFrequently, also the nervous system is involved, so we work closely with our neurology team, to have that checked for \nyou as well.\nShould you be diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will get you a timely appointment with our hemato-oncologist, to make \nsure effective treatment will be initiated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,

    &quot;&lt;p&gt;The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. \nWe can detect in the ECG your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. \nThe process of obtaining an ECG is simple. \nA nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, \nand within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. \nDuring that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.\nThis way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have rarely, i.e. daily or every other day in the \ncase of the 48-hour ECG.\nThis 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular \ndaily activities.\nThe goal is to see, if during your regular daily activities, you are developing any problems in your heart rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.\nWhen you think your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.\nIt is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when \nyour heart makes extra beats).&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Implantation of an event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the \nskin of your upper chest.\nSince the implantable event recorder is an invasive procedure, it is used for patients with suspected asymptomatic \nrhythm problems, i.e. who do not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.\nSince those patients would not know when to activate an external event recorder, an implantable event recorder is used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In order to get a good overview, what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we have a device that you can \ncarry for a total of 24 hours. \nIt is not large and can be worn at your hip.\nThat device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day \nand every 30 minutes during the night.\nThis way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at \nspecific times of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Exercise-stress test is a great way to objectively test your physical fitness.\nAlso, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you \nexercise.\nFurthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise – often a cause for limited exercise \ntolerance.\nECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may \nrequire further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart \nmuscle, function of the walls and the valves. \nAlso, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.\nThis information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.\nDuring the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by \nstructures in your heart.\nThrough collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.\nThis examination does not have any known relevant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.\nWith dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect \nthat the heart vessels may be diseased.\nYou will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.\nThat way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your hear vessels have.\nIf we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart don’t pump as well under \nphysical stress, we may suggest for you to undergo cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some \nvessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.\nIf the test is negative and all walls contract well, then no further action is needed for now. In addition, we can test \ndysfunction of your valves with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In certain clinical scenarios, we may have to check if your carotid arteries or other arteries of the body are healthy \nor if they have narrowings that may require intervention.\nFor that we will use again ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging of the heart will allow us to detect structural abnormalities in the heart, inflammation, \nstorage diseases or poor blood supply to the heart.\nAlso, CMR may reveal prognostic information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;PET is a technology that we use in particular for patients with sarcoidosis.\nSarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that can be categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.\nIt is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, \nsince it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the suspicion for narrowed or obstructed vessels in the heart is high or if you have been diagnosed with a relevant \nvalve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or \ncardiac catheterization.\nUnder local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentist’s office), a small catheter \n(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the area of your wrist or your groin.\nThen contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any \nnarrowings or occlusion.\nIf there are any, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.\nA stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and \nremain there, once the balloon is inflated.\nAfter that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.\nAfter that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open again.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;In patients, in whom the cause for their illness of the heart could not be identified yet, we may obtain endomyocardial \nor heart biopsies.\nTypically, we obtain up to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.\nThe procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.\nYou may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.\nThis procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive \nprocedure through a small catheter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we have a protective device for you to interrupt arrhythmias \nshould they occur.\nWith severely decreased function, the risk of arrhythmias is increased.\nIf the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is &amp;lt; or = 35%, in most cases we will \noffer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.\nDuring the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have \nthe highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.\nShould the pump function not improve, you may require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nShould that be the case, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
