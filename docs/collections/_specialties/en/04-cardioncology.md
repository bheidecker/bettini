heading: Cardiooncology and Checkpoint Inhibitor Induced Myocarditis
---

Cardiooncology focuses on the care of patients with heart disease or those at risk of developing it before, during, or after cancer therapy.
The primary goal is to deliver the most effective cancer treatment while minimizing the risk of cardiovascular complications.

This field requires close interdisciplinary collaboration between cardiologists and hematologists or oncologists.
A specific and emerging area within cardiooncology is checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis.
Checkpoint inhibitor therapy aims to enhance the immune system’s ability to fight advanced cancer by “disinhibiting” it, enabling a stronger response against metastatic disease.

However, this enhanced immune activity increases the risk of autoimmune reactions, including myocarditis — an inflammation of the heart muscle.
If checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis occurs, immediate referral to a specialized center is critical for ensuring the best possible outcome for the patient.
