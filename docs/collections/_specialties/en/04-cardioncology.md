heading: Cardiooncology and Checkpoint Inhibitor Induced Myocarditis
---

Cardiooncology covers the care of patients who have heart disease or who are at risk of heart disease before, 
during, or after cancer therapy.
The goal is to provide the most effective cancer therapy, while reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications to a 
minimum. 
The care involves close interdisciplinary collaboration between the cardiologist and the hematologist or oncologist. 
A specific new field of cardiooncology is checkpoint inhibitor induced myocarditis.
The goal of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in oncology is to make the patient’s immune defense stronger and more 
aggressive against advanced cancer through a mechanism of "disinhibition", which enables the immune system to fight metastatic 
disease.
However, this disinhibition comes with the price of a higher risk for autoimmune reactions and myocarditis – an 
inflammation of the heart muscle.
If checkpoint inhibitor induced myocarditis occurs, immediate referral for treatment in a specialized center is 
crucial for a patient's outcome.
