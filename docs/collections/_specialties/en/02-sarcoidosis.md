Sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory cells (the bodyâ€™s defense cells) forming round-shaped granulomas, which can occur in any part of the body.
As cardiologists, we treat patients with cardiac involvement, although the disease most commonly affects the lungs and lymph nodes.

The exact cause of sarcoidosis remains unknown, but it is suspected to result from an immune response to environmental factors such as dust, chemicals, or infectious agents.
Many patients also report experiencing significant stress prior to the onset of the disease, which is a known trigger for autoimmune conditions.

Sarcoidosis is treatable, but early diagnosis is essential for preventing irreversible damage.
