HCM (Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy) is a condition characterized by abnormally thickened heart muscle cells, a process known as hypertrophy.
As a result, the walls of the heart become thicker and stiffer.

This can sometimes make it more difficult for the heart to pump or relax properly, causing symptoms such as chest pain. In more advanced stages, patients may develop fluid accumulation (edema) in the legs or lungs. Additionally, patients with HCM may experience electrical conduction issues or arrhythmias.

The diagnosis of HCM is sometimes delayed because symptoms often develop later in the disease progression.
