The diagnosis of myocarditis refers to inflammation of the heart, which may be caused by a virus or other triggering factors.
It often involves an autoimmune reaction that, in some cases, requires medications to suppress the immune system.

The majority of myocarditis cases recover well. However, more severe cases may necessitate closer monitoring, intensive therapy, and more frequent follow-ups. Following myocarditis, it is strongly advised to avoid intense physical activity for at least three months, as the risk of exercise-induced arrhythmias and worsening of the condition has been documented in medical literature. Prof. Heidecker and her team conducted the first human study on resuming sports after three months and observed no medical complications after this period.

For additional information about myocarditis, you may find the website of the [Myocarditis Foundation](https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/){:target="\_blank"} helpful. Prof. Heidecker serves as a member of the foundation's Board of Directors.
