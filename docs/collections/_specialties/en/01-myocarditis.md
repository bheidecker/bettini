The diagnosis myocarditis describes inflammation of the heart that may be caused by a virus or other triggering factors.
We typically see an autoimmune reaction that may sometimes require medications that suppress the immune system.
The large majority of cases with myocarditis recover well.
Some cases are more severe and require more intense monitoring, therapy and more frequent follow up.
After myocarditis, it is strongly recommended not to do any heavy exercise for at least 3 months, as the risk of 
exercise induced arrhythmias and worsening of the disease has been reported in the literature.  We have done the 
first study in humans resuming sports after 3 months and did not observe any medical issues developing after that 
interval.
