Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare heart muscle disease that occurs during the final month of pregnancy or up to five months after delivery and may lead to heart failure.
Before diagnosing peripartum cardiomyopathy, it is essential to rule out other potential causes of cardiomyopathy.

In most cases, peripartum cardiomyopathy develops shortly after delivery.
The severity of symptoms can vary widely among women but does not appear to impact the likelihood of recovery.
Women with severely reduced heart function due to peripartum cardiomyopathy may still experience a full recovery.

Overall, compared to other types of cardiomyopathies, peripartum cardiomyopathy carries a relatively good prognosis for recovery.
As with other cardiomyopathies, early initiation of treatment is crucial.

The risk of recurrence during subsequent pregnancies is generally higher for patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy, particularly for those who did not fully recover their heart function. Consultation with a specialist is strongly recommended before planning future pregnancies.
