Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can be deposited in various organs including the heart.
In our clinic, we most commonly see Thransthyretin Amyloidosis/ATTR or Light Chain Amyloidosis/AL.
Deposition of the protein causes heart stiffness, potentially leading to heart failure and arrhythmias.
Appropriate medical therapy that may require frequent dose adjustment is very important for the clinical course of a patient.
Endomyocardial biopsy has a very high sensitivity and specificity for amyloidosis (almost 100%).
Therefore, it is the preferred diagnostic tool, when there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis.
Only if the suspicion is very low, we may perform imaging first.
Frequently, also the nervous system is affected by amyloidosis.  Therefore, we work closely with our neurology team who will evaluate you as well, if you agree. Should you be diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will get you a timely appointment with our hemato-oncologist to make sure effective treatment will be initiated promptly.
