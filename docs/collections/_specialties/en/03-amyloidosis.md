Amyloid is a misfolded protein that can accumulate in various organs, including the heart.
In our clinic, the most common types we encounter are transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) and light chain amyloidosis (AL).
Protein deposition in the heart causes stiffness, which can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.

Proper medical therapy, often requiring frequent dose adjustments, is crucial for managing a patientâ€™s clinical course.
When there is reasonable suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis, endomyocardial biopsy is the preferred diagnostic tool due to its very high sensitivity and specificity (nearly 100%). If the suspicion is low, imaging may be performed first.

Amyloidosis often affects the nervous system as well. For this reason, we work closely with our neurology team, who can evaluate you with your consent. If you are diagnosed with AL amyloidosis, we will promptly arrange an appointment with our hemato-oncologist to ensure effective treatment is initiated without delay.
