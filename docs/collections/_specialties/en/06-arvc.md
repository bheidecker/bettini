Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a structural disease of the heart muscle, in which normal heart 
muscle is replaced by fatty fibrous tissue.
Due to the fatty replacement, electrical signal conduction in the heart is hampered leading to an irregular rhythm that 
can become life-threatening. Also, the heart can lose its pump function and get weaker over time leading to symptoms of 
heart failure.
Usually, the right chamber of the heart is primarily affected, which gave the disease its name.
However, also the left chamber can be affected in combination and in very rare cases in isolation. 
ARVC is a genetic disease with first symptom onset from age 10 to 50 years.
