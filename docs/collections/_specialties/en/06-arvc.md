Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a structural heart muscle disease in which normal heart muscle is replaced by fatty fibrous tissue.
This fatty replacement disrupts electrical signal conduction in the heart, leading to irregular rhythms that can become life-threatening.
Over time, the heart may also lose its pump function, resulting in symptoms of heart failure.

The disease primarily affects the right chamber of the heart, which is how it got its name.
However, the left chamber can also be involved, either in combination with the right or, in very rare cases, in isolation.
ARVC is a genetic condition, with symptoms typically appearing between the ages of 10 and 50 years.
