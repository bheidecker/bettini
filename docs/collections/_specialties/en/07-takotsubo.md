Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome, was first described in Japan in 1990. It is named after the takotsubo, a Japanese container used to catch octopus, due to the characteristic shape of the heart in patients with TCM.

In TCM, part of the left chamber of the heart - most often the apex - enlarges into a balloon-like shape, resulting in poor pump function in that area. The rest of the chamber compensates to maintain overall function. Patients typically present with severe chest pain, resembling a heart attack, or symptoms such as shortness of breath, weakness, and signs of heart failure.

In most cases, TCM is a temporary condition with a high likelihood of full recovery.
However, it requires several days of monitoring, as severe arrhythmias can occur during the acute phase.
TCM is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress or pro-adrenergic medications commonly used in intensive care.
Yet, TCM is occasionally observed in patients without exposure to any known triggers.

Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of this condition.
