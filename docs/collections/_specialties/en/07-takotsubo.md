Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome.
TCM was first described in Japan in 1990 and named after Takotsubo - a container that is used in Japan to catch octopus.
It refers to the typical shape of a patient's heart, who presents with TCM.
In general, one part of the left chamber of the heart enlarges in a balloon shape form (most of the time the apex of 
the heart) leading to poor pump function in that area, while the rest of the chamber tries to compensate. 
Patients with TCM frequently present with severe chest pain, as if they are having a heart attack or shortness of 
breath and general weakness associated with symptoms of heart failure.
TCM in most cases is a temporary condition with high chance for full recovery. 
However, it requires several days of monitoring, as severe arrhythmias may occur in the acute phase. 
It can be triggered by high emotional or physical stress and pro-adrenergic medications that are used in the intensive 
care unit.
However, sometimes we find TCM in patients, who were not exposed to any of those known triggers. 
Certainly, more research is needed in this area to understand its pathophysiology better.
