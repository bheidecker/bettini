After a long odyssey through several hospitals and cardiologists, I arrived at Dr. Heidecker’s clinic at the Charité. Previously I was told that I was not allowed to move anymore due to my illness and that I should accept it as fate. Through the therapy and advice of Dr. Heidecker, I have recovered from my illness well enough to work again. Thank you again for the great care. No distance is too long for my health, so I don't shy away from driving 300 km every time to find myself in good hands.
