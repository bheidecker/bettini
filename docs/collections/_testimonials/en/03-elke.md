For several years, I have been treated by Dr. Heidecker for my giant cell myocarditis.
As a patient, I always experience her as very approachable and extremely friendly.
Dr. Heidecker, as far as I can tell, is highly competent in her field and familiar with the latest developments, innovations and advances in her area of expertise.
She goes above and beyond the usual level of patient care.
For this reason, I gladly accept a very long journey of more than 500 km to her clinic in order to be treated in the best possible way.
