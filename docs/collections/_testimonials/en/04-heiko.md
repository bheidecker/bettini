In Dr. Heidecker's care I feel in very good hands. My therapy plan and information about my illness are excellent.
If necessary, the medication is adjusted in order to achieve the best possible therapy.
Dr. Heidecker also has the experience, the necessary clinical judgment and sensitivity to recognize possible changes in the clinical condition.
My particular condition requires the best treatment and I get that from Dr. Heidecker.
