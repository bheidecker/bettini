Dr. Heidecker helped me during a very, very difficult phase of my illness and gave me support. With her knowledge and expertise, she is able to reassure patients and give them hope. Given her dedication and interest in a patient's condition, one is in very good hands and lucky to be treated by her. She excels in her profession and I am very happy to have her as my doctor.
