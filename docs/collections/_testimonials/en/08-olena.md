Dr. Heidecker is a very good and competent doctor, who exudes confidence. She was also very helpful with my limited German and spoke fluent English with me. She listened so closely to me and was really interested in discovering the cause of my symptoms. Dr. Heidecker performed all the necessary tests to make sure everything was okay with my heart. 
Dr. Heidecker takes time for you, listens to you and makes you feel understood. Thanks a lot!
