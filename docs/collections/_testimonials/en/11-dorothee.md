Professor Dr. Heidecker is an exceptional cardiologist who, after I had a long odyssey through various other hospitals, finally provided me with the correct treatment for my chronic pericarditis in her clinic. What impresses me most is her strong commitment to research: she is deeply dedicated to advancing the understanding of myocarditis and cardiomyopathies, and through this work has significantly improved the care of many patients. Her dedication goes far beyond what is usually expected. I gladly travel a long distance to Berlin for my appointments with her, as I feel excellently cared for by her both medically and personally. Professor Heidecker combines scientific excellence with genuine compassion - a combination that is rarely found in everyday clinical practice. My heartfelt thanks for that.
