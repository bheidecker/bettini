Dr. Heidecker took me into her care towards the end of my Olympic athlete career.
Together we were able to ensure a healthy transition from competitive sports to a life without it (competitive sports).

Dr. Heidecker always convinced me with her professionally competent and friendly manner. I always felt well taken care of and safe in her clinic. 

I would like to emphasize in particular her intensive interest in the latest scientific discoveries, which came into play in all treatment steps.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the intensive support!
