With a rare autoimmune heart disease, I am very glad to be in the care of PD. Dr. Heidecker. She takes very care of my current therapy in a highly competent manner, as well as further necessary steps. As a patient, I benefit from Frau Dr. Heidecker's collaboration with national and international colleagues in the field. Furthermore, I highly appreciate her friendly manner and feel very well taken care of.
