Having an acute myocarditis, I was lucky to find Dr. Heidecker's clinic. The diagnosis was made quickly, and Dr. Heidecker provided clear explanation of the treatment steps. With a lot of empathy and noticeable expertise in her field, she helped relieve my fears and anxiety about the diagnosis. To take into account all possible risks, further functional examinations were performed so that sarcoidosis could be ruled out. As a long-time runner, I can now pursue running again. I feel that I am in very good hands with Dr. Heidecker.
