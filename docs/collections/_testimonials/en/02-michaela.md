For three years I have been followed and treated by Dr. Heidecker for my cardiac sarcoidosis.
The routine examination includes first an ECG and then the pacemaker check, followed by the conversation and the ultrasound examination of the heart by Dr. Heidecker.
Finally, a blood sample is taken.
The topic of the conversation is of course the physical condition as well as the medication and any adjustments that need to be made.
I feel the need to point out that Dr. Heidecker is a very warm and human doctor,
who expresses herself in layman terms and who patiently answers all the questions you want to ask.
She takes her time and is open any personal questions. I appreciate her approachable and
extremely competent manner and I am very grateful to have found a specialist in this field in her.
For this I also accept a 500 km journey. With this serious diagnosis, I feel in the very best hands with Dr. Heidecker.
