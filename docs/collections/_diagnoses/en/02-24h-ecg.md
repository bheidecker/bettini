heading: Holter Monitor/24-Hour ECG
---

In some cases, it is necessary to monitor the ECG for an extended period, typically 24 or 48 hours.
During this time, the ECG continuously records your heart rhythm, allowing us to identify rhythm issues that may occur only occasionally, such as once a day or every other day.

The 24- or 48-hour ECG uses a compact, wearable device that is easy to carry.
You are encouraged to continue your normal daily activities while wearing it.
The goal is to determine whether you experience any rhythm abnormalities during your everyday life.
In rare cases, a 7-day monitoring device may be used.
