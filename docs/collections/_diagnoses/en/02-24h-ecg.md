heading: Holter Monitor/24-Hour ECG
---

Sometimes it is necessary to wear the ECG for a longer period of time, which may be 24 or 48 hours. 
During that time, the ECG will continuously record your rhythm.
This way, we are able to catch rhythm problems that you might only have occasionally, for example daily or every other day.
The 24- or 48-hour ECG comes with an easily wearable device, so you are able to - and should - pursue your regular 
daily activities.
The goal is to see, if you develop any rhythm abnormalities during your every day life. In rare cases, we may use a 7-day monitoring device.
