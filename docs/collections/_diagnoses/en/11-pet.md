PET is a technology that we use in particular for patients with sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that can be categorized as a subtype of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathies.
PET CT is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis as it is an ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease. Before patients undergo PET CT, they have to eat a special diet for 2 days, which is rich in fat and low in carbohydrates.   On the third day, the patients receives a glucose solution that will help detect areas in the body that contain active sarcoidosis lesions.
