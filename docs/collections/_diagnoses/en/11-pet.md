PET is a technology that we use in particular for patients with sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that can be categorized as a subtype of myocarditis.
It is important to monitor treatment response in sarcoidosis and a goldstandard for that is PET, 
since it is the ideal method to detect metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which reflects active disease.
