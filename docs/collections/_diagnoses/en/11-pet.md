PET is a diagnostic technology particularly useful for patients with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease of the heart that is considered a subtype of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathies.

PET CT is especially valuable for monitoring treatment response in sarcoidosis.
It is an ideal method for detecting metabolic activity in sarcoid granulomas, which indicates active disease.
Before undergoing PET CT, patients follow a special diet for two days that is high in fat and low in carbohydrates.
On the third day, they receive a glucose solution to help identify areas in the body with active sarcoidosis lesions.
