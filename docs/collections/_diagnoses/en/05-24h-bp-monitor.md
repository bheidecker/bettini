heading: 24-hour Blood Pressure Monitoring
---

To gain a comprehensive understanding of your blood pressure throughout the day, we use a device designed for 24-hour monitoring.
The device is compact and can be worn on your hip.

It connects to a blood pressure cuff that measures your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night.
This continuous monitoring helps identify periods when your blood pressure is too high or too low, allowing us to optimize your blood pressure medication accordingly.
