heading: 24-hour Blood Pressure Monitoring
---

In order to get a good overview what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we use a device that you can 
carry for a total of 24 hours. 
It is not large and can be worn at your hip.
The device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day 
and every 30 minutes during the night.
This way we are trying to find out if there are times during the day, when your blood pressure is too high or too low.  This helps us to optimize your blood pressure medications.
