heading: 24-hour blood pressure monitoring
---

In order to get a good overview, what your blood pressure looks like during the day, we have a device that you can 
carry for a total of 24 hours. 
It is not large and can be worn at your hip.
That device is connected to a blood pressure cuff that will measure your blood pressure every 15 minutes during the day 
and every 30 minutes during the night.
This way, we may find out if there are times, when your blood pressure is too high or too low, which may be always at 
specific times of the day.
