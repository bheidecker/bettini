heading: Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography

Dobutamine stress echocardiography is a test used to determine whether the vessels in your heart are partially or completely blocked.
This test helps assess the risk of heart attack in patients suspected of having diseased heart vessels.
It evaluates both wall motion and heart valve dysfunction.

During the procedure, you receive a medication called Dobutamine, which makes your heart beat faster and harder.
This allows us to evaluate how your heart performs under stress and to measure the reserve capacity of your heart vessels.

If the ultrasound (echocardiography) shows areas of the heart that do not pump well during stress, we may recommend cardiac catheterization or coronary angiography to check for narrowed vessels that might require stenting.
Conversely, if the test is negative and all heart walls contract well, further diagnostic workup is typically unnecessary.
