heading: Dobutamin-Stressechocardiography

This test is used to find out if vessels in your heart may be partially or completely blocked.
With dobutamin-stressechocardiography, we are trying to reduce the risk for heart attack in patients in whom we suspect 
that their heart vessels may be diseased.
You will receive a medication called Dobutamin that may make your heart beat faster and harder.
That way, we can assess how your heart performs under stress and how much reserve your heart vessels have.
If we see in the ultrasound of your heart/the echocardiography that areas of your heart donâ€™t pump well during
stress, we may recommend you to have cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography to check, if some 
vessels may be narrowed and may require stenting.
If the test is negative and all walls of the heart contract well, then no further diagnostic workup is needed in most cases. In addition to wall motion, we can test dysfunction of your heart valves with this technology.
