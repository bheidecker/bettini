heading: Implantable Event Recorder
---

Implantation of an event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure in which a very small device is implanted under the 
skin of your upper chest.
Since the implantable event recorder is a minimally invasive procedure, it is only used for a specific group of patients who are asymptomatic but suspected to have rhythm problems.  Those patients would not be able to activate an external event recorder, as they would not feel when their rhythm is abnormal.  Therefore, an implantable event recorder is a better option for those patients.
