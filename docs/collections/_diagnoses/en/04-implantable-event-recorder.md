heading: Implantable Event Recorder

An implantable event recorder is a small device placed under the skin of your upper chest in a minimally invasive procedure.

This device is specifically used for patients who are asymptomatic but suspected of having rhythm problems.
Unlike an external event recorder, which requires activation during symptoms, an implantable event recorder is ideal for patients who cannot feel when their rhythm is abnormal, allowing continuous monitoring and detection of irregularities.
