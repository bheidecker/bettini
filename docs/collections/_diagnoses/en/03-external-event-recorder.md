An external event recorder is a small device that you can carry in your pocket for about 3 months.
Each time, when you feel that your rhythm problems might be happening, you can activate the device to record your rhythm.
It is ideal for patients who experience rhythm problems rarely, with symptoms like racing heart and palpitations (when 
your heart makes extra beats and pauses). This way, we are able to catch those moments and review them carefully, to evaluate if specific treatment is necessary.
