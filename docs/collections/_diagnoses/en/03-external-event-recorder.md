An external event recorder is a compact device that you can carry in your pocket for up to three months.
Each time you sense potential rhythm problems, you can activate the device to record your heart rhythm.

This tool is particularly useful for patients who experience rhythm issues infrequently, such as episodes of a racing heart or palpitations (extra beats or pauses in the heartbeat).
By capturing these episodes, we can carefully review the recordings to determine whether specific treatment is needed.
