If there is a strong suspicion of narrowed or obstructed heart vessels, or if you are diagnosed with significant valve disease or another type of structural heart disease, we may recommend coronary angiography or cardiac catheterization.

During this procedure, you receive local anesthesia (a numbing medication similar to what is used at the dentist).
A small catheter, about the diameter of a spaghetti strand, is inserted into an artery in your wrist or groin.
Contrast fluid is injected into your heart vessels while X-ray imaging (fluoroscopy) is used to check for any narrowings or blockages in the arteries.

If obstructions are found, we try to open the affected arteries during the same procedure using a stent.
A stent is a metal mesh attached to a deflated balloon on the catheter.
Once the balloon inflates, the stent expands to fit the artery and remains in place when the balloon and catheter are removed.
After the procedure, the vessel is fully open in the stented area. If stenting is not technically feasible, we will discuss other therapy options after the procedure.
