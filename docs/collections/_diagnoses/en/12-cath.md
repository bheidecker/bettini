If the suspicion for narrowed or obstructed vessels in the heart is high or if you have been diagnosed with a relevant 
valve disease or other types of structural heart disease, we may recommend you to have a coronary angiography or 
cardiac catheterization.
Under local anesthesia (with numbing medication similar to what you get at the dentistâ€™s office), a small catheter 
(diameter of a spaghetti) will be inserted either in the artery in the area of your wrist or your groin.
Then contrast fluid will be injected in your heart vessels under continuous X-ray/fluoroscopy to see if there are any 
narrowings or occlusions of the arteries.
If there are obstructions of the arteries, we will try to open them during the same procedure with a stent.
A stent is a metal mesh sitting on a deflated balloon on the inserted catheter, which will expand into your vessel and 
remain there, once the balloon is inflated.
After that, balloon and catheter will be removed and the stent will remain.
After that, the vessel is expected to be 100% open in the area of the stent.
The procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.
