Echocardiography is an ultrasound examination of the heart that provides detailed images of the size, wall motion, and function of your heart chambers, as well as the function of your heart valves.
It also allows us to estimate pressures within the heart and detect any valve leakage or narrowing.

During the procedure, an ultrasound probe sends sound waves to your heart, which are reflected by its structures.
These reflected waves are used to create an image of your heart.
The information obtained is highly valuable for diagnosis and treatment.

Echocardiography is a safe procedure with no known relevant side effects.
