During echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart 
chambers, chamber function, and valve function.   
Also, we can estimate the pressure in the heart and check if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.
This information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.
During echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by 
structures of your heart.
Through collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.
This examination does not have any known relevant side effects.
