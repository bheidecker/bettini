heading: Endomyocardial Biopsy/Heart Biopsy
---

In patients whose heart condition cannot be diagnosed using standard methods, we may recommend an endomyocardial or heart biopsy.

This procedure is performed under local anesthesia and, similar to cardiac catheterization, is minimally invasive.
A small catheter is used to obtain the biopsy samples.
Typically, we obtain 4 to 6 small samples, each about 1mm in size.
The procedure is generally painless because pain medication is used.
You may feel a few extra beats while the samples are taken.
