In patients, in whom the cause for their illness of the heart could not be identified with standard diagnostic methods, we may recommend to perform an endomyocardial or heart biopsy.
Typically, we obtain 4 to 6 samples that are about 1mm big.
The procedure usually does not hurt, since pain medication will be used.
You may feel a few extrabeats while the samples are taken.
This procedure is also done under local anesthesia and similar to cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive 
procedure through a small catheter.
