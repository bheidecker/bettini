The exercise-stress test is an effective way to objectively assess your physical fitness.
It also helps identify whether you are at risk of developing arrhythmias specifically triggered by exercise.

Additionally, the test can reveal if your blood pressure rises excessively during exercise, which is often a cause of limited exercise tolerance.
Changes in the ECG or symptoms like chest pain during the test may indicate narrowed heart vessels, potentially requiring further evaluation.
