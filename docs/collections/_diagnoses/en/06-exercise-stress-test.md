Exercise-stress test is a great way to objectively test your physical fitness.
Also, it can provide us with the information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you 
exercise.
Furthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise â€“ often a cause for limited exercise 
tolerance.
ECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign of your heart vessels being narrowed, which may require further evaluation.
