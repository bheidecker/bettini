The ECG is used to check the electrical activity of the heart. 
In the ECG, we can detect your heart rate, rhythm problems, or abnormalities that suggest your heart may need treatment. 
The process of obtaining an ECG is simple. 
A nurse puts electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, 
and within a few seconds the ECG device records the necessary measurements.
