ECG is a tool used to assess the heartâ€™s electrical activity.
It can help detect heart rate, rhythm abnormalities, or other issues that may indicate the need for treatment.

The process of obtaining an ECG is quick and straightforward. A nurse places electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs, and within a few seconds, the ECG device records the necessary measurements.
