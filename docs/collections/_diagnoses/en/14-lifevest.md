If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we can offer a protective device with the ability to terminate severe arrhythmias should they ever occur.
With severely decreased function, the risk of severe arrhythmias is increased.
If the pump function of your left chamber/the left ventricular ejection fraction is < or = 35%, in most cases we will 
offer this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.
During the first 3 months after diagnosis of severely decreased pump function (not caused by vessel problems), we have 
the highest chance for improvement of your heart with medical therapy.  Therefore, the LifeVest is a good temporary solution to proect from severe arrhythmias.
Should the pump function not improve, we will evaluate, if you are a suitable candidate for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).
If you require an ICD, our team will inform you in detail about its risks and benefits, as for all other procedures.
