If the pump function of your heart is severely decreased, we can offer a protective device capable of terminating severe arrhythmias if they occur.
The risk of severe arrhythmias is higher when heart function is significantly reduced.

If the pump function of your left chamber (left ventricular ejection fraction) is 35% or less, we typically recommend wearing this wearable cardioverter defibrillator device for at least 3 months.
During the first 3 months after a diagnosis of severely decreased heart function (not caused by vessel issues), medical therapy offers the highest chance for improvement. Therefore, the LifeVest serves as a temporary solution to protect against severe arrhythmias, which also provides monitoring to track your heart rhythm.

If heart function does not improve, we will evaluate whether you are a suitable candidate for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). If an ICD is necessary, our team will thoroughly explain its risks and benefits, as we do with all other procedures.
