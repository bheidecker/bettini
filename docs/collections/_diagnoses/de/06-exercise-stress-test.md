Exercise-stress test is a great way to objectively test your physical fitness.
Also, it can provide us with information, if you are at risk for arrhythmias that may develop specifically when you 
exercise.
Furthermore, we can detect, if your blood pressure gets too high during exercise â€“ often a cause for limited exercise 
tolerance.
ECG changes during exercise stress testing or symptoms of chest pain may be a sign that your vessels in the heart may 
require further evaluation.
