In echocardiography we perform an ultrasound of your heart that will visualize the size and wall motion of your heart 
muscle, function of the walls and the valves. 
Also, we can test if there is leakage or narrowing of the heart valves.
This information is very valuable for diagnosis and treatment.
During the echocardiography, an ultrasound probe sends out ultrasound waves to your heart, which will be reflected by 
structures in your heart.
Through collection of those reflected waves, the ultrasound probe creates an image of your heart.
This examination does not have any known relevant side effects.
